 DOCUMENTATION
 
 Program Purpose:
 	Looping, Formatting
 Compile (assuming Cygwin is running): g++ -o Assignment1Question3 Assignment1Question3.cpp
 Execution (assuming Cygwin is running): ./Assignment1Question3
 
 Notes: in Cygwin, main must return type int
 
 Classes: none

 Variables:
 c - float - temperature in celcius
 f - float - temperature in fahrenheit
 SIZE - const int - for setw (size for each cells)
 DEC - const int - for setting the precision
*/

/*
 TEST PLAN
 The plan is to run this code, copy the output, and paste it into a file comparison tool online to compare it to the example output
 given. Once they are identical, I know I have formatted correctly.

 Discussion:
 Using this test plan worked fine, but it did not tell me exactly what was wrong with the document; I had to manually highlight each table and compare the 
 amount of spaces to each, and eye-ball which spaces were uneven/different.

//these are the same functions from the last question, which I copied and pasted. Another way I could have had these functions in this code is if I created a 
//library with these two conversion functions within it, and include the header for the library in this code.
